# S.A.M.E
Navigating Management of the Rapidly Decompensating Patient: S.A.M.E - Software Application for Medical Emergencies

Techstack:
Frontend - Flutter
Backend - Node.js
Database - MongoDB

To run the application you must have flutter and node.js installed. Following these installations, all necessary packages must also be installed. A personal database's access key must be specified in backend/app.js in the uri variable. The database must use mongoDB as a platform. Running node app.js will start the server and connect to the database automatically. Then run the flutter app through main.dart.

The artifact chosen to be implemented is the admin symptom adding functionality as it checks all parts of the tech stack along with serving as an important part of the application.
